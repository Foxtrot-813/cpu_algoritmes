# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To use these algorithms:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Foxtrot-813/cpu_algoritmes.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd cpu_algoritmes
   ```
3. Run the desired algorithm script:
   ```
   python3 <algorithm_name>.py
   ```
   Replace `<algorithm_name>` with the name of the script you want to run (e.g., `priority_first.py`, `round_robin.py`, etc.)
